# Apple Threat Data / iPhone Diagnostic Logs

This repository contains partial **iPhone diagnostic log datasets** and **timelines generated with [Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT)](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt)** from devices that **received Apple Threat Notifications**.

---

## Dataset Overview

Contents include:
- **Partial iPhone Diagnostic Logs** (`DiagnosticLogs/`)  
  Extracted from iOS sysdiagnose and related modules, covering crash reports, network traces, and process behavior snapshots.
- **Timeline Files** (`timeline.csv`)  
  Automatically generated by MVT, aggregating system-level events for forensic and threat analysis.

> ⚠️ Only partial data is shared due to storage and privacy constraints.

## Privacy & Data Sanitization

Sensitive user data such as names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and GPS coordinates have been **partially anonymized**.  
Any attempt to deanonymize or re-identify individuals is strictly prohibited.

---

## Research Purpose

These datasets come from iPhones that received **Apple Threat Notifications**, often linked to state-sponsored attacks.  
The goals are:
- To study **zero-click exploit traces** in iOS logs.  
- To evaluate potential **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** within system telemetry.  
- To support reproducible community-driven research in **mobile threat forensics**.
